\begin{abstract} 
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) - one of the basic tools in data analysis - aims to find a coordinate system in which the components of the data are independent. In many cases the number of sources is unknown and may be less than the number of sensors. In such situation we are looking for so-called non-square mixing matrix.

Due to computational constraints, principal component analysis is often used for dimension reduction prior to ICA (PCA+ICA). However, such approach often removes important information.
In this paper we present a method which is dedicated for determining non-square mixing matrix in ICA maximum likelihood framework.
