\begin{abstract} 
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) - one of the basic tools in data analysis - aims to find a coordinate system in which the components of the data are independent. In many application the number of sources is unknown and may be less than the number of sensors. In such situation we are looking for so-called non-square mixing matrix.
Due to computational constraints, principal component analysis is used for dimension reduction prior to ICA (PCA+ICA),
which could remove important information.
In this paper we present a two method which are dedicated for determining non-square mixing matrix by fitting non Gaussian densities.

% created by Lise Getoor and Tobias Scheffer, it was slightly modified  
% from the 2010 version by Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, 
% slightly modified from the 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and 
% Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is slightly modified from
